I am still adding support for the player thread.

audio component owns a DAC
it spawns a player
other folks (connect manager) can add hardware command to the player thread
commands like play, stop, resume and pause.

The player thread is either idle or playing.
if it is playing, it will heck for commands in a nonblocking way
if it is idle it is sem_waiting.
